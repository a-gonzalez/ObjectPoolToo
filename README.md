Another great lesson from https://www.youtube.com/@Frankslaboratory and again, a great shout-out to Frank. El mago.

From Frank:

Robots, body parts and game design. Deep dive into 2D character animation and motion. Let's build a space robot from multiple separate body parts and let's make them interactive. Building games can be easy if you understand your tools and techniques. Let's learn 2D Game development with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 canvas element.
